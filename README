I made this game when I was 15 years old. 

I am dedicating this Github Repo to updating this and essentially making a version 2. Nothing will change, really except hopefully some of the bugs I have discovered will be fixed.
Also I will be implementing new things I have learnt such as multiple classes rather then just one. Hopefully this will allow the game to remain easy to edit.
